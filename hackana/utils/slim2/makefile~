# a very simple makefile, which builds a shared library <package_name>.so
# from all the .C files in the package directory
#
# The only dependencies are on ROOT
#
# The shared library is deposited in the local (e.g. build) directory
# in principle it is better to move all libraries into one lib/ directory
# in a "make install" step but this makefile doesn't do that
